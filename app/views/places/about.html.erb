<h2>What about Amble?</h2>
<p>
  Inspired by the incredibly functional user interface of Urbanspoon,
  we wanted to create a mobile application to help tourists 
  discover interesting new places in Melbourne quickly and easily.
  
  The concept: a visitor will wander around, discovering sights and activities,
  while Amble will provide a steady stream of imagery of further locations to explore.
  
  The core idea is that the application is a stream of easily digestible information,
  whilst providing only those features which are absolutely necessary.

<blockquote>
  In short: to help new people discover new places&hellips; 
    to be as helpful as possible whilst distracting as little as possible.
</blockquote>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
  The main goal of Amble was, as with all great mobile applications, 
  to get the data to the user as quickly as possible. Further, we focussed 
  on the following:
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Clear, graphical Places.</em>
      <p>Mobile users don't have time to read long descriptions. A picture tells
        a thousand words.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Simple Sign-on.</em>
      <p>We chose to use Facebook Connect to make log in as simple as possible 
           for the vast majority of users.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Simple Interface.</em>
      <p>
        We pared the features down to the absolute minimum required, in order to
        build a great product.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Great Data.</em>
      <p>
        We used the wealth of data provided by the Victorian Government, and
        cross-referenced it with other online sources to create a very high-quality
        dataset.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  Our goals: to craft a more human approach to discovery&hellips; 
  to encourage activity and meaningful connections.

  Although we had many great ideas for features that would make the product very useful
  to our users, we want to craft an app that would convey the core idea without distraction.
  
  Some features that we will consider adding in the future include:<br/>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>
  We initially decided the application would be most useful to mobile users. 
  As we were most familiar with the iPhone platform, we began with an iPhone
  application, however we quickly decided that we needed to be able to reach a
  greater audience.
  
  So we created a mobile web application. Although it was developed primarily for
  the iPhone, it works on the Android platform, and FIXME...
  
  An added benefit of this approach is that it was simple to create a website
  accessible from any computer. Although not as useful to such users as it is to
  mobile users on the go, we envisage users using the website to plan trips before time.

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

  We hope our entry has given a taste of what ...
